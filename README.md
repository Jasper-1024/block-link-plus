# Obsidian Block Link Plus

[copy-block-link](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link/tree/main) is one of my most frequently used plugins. However, it has always lacked support for creating multi-line text blocks. Therefore, I attempted to write block-link-plus. block-link-plus supports the creation of multi-line text blocks and offers more customization for block IDs.

for chinese version, please refer to [README_zh.md](README_zh.md)

## Usage

The usage is completely the same as [copy-block-link](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-copy-block-link/tree/main).

## Features

### Multi-line Text Blocks

Here, multi-line text specifically refers to: selected text that does not contain any titles across multiple lines.

Obsidian's block reference has not yet supported the creation of multi-line text blocks. block-link-plus uses two methods as a workaround.

The first method is using headings: adding the selected text to a new heading and copying the link pointing to that heading.
- Distinguish using `˅id` from normal headings
- Modify the rendering of `## ˅id` under reading mode and live preview to make it more similar to a normal block reference.


```bash
## ˅id
abc
def
## ^id

[[file#˅id]]
```

The second method creates multiple block references: batch creating multiple sets of block references and copying them to the clipboard
- This feature is inspired by @[Text Transporter](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter)

```bash
abc ^id1

def ^id2

gh ^id3

[[file#^id1]]
[[file#^id2]]
[[file#^id3]]
```

### Custom Block ID

Block ID = prefix-random characters
- Customize the prefix of the block ID and the length of random characters (3-7)

This feature currently does not have more practical uses, but perhaps more aggregation operations can be performed through the prefix of the block ID.

## Thanks

Block Link Plus is my first Obsidian plugin. During the development process, I referred to a large number of existing plugins. I am grateful to these open-source projects.
