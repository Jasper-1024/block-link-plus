# Tasks

- [x] Implement subtree clipboard extension for block selection mode (copy/cut/paste).
- [x] Use internal MIME payload + external-friendly `text/plain` without system lines.
- [x] Paste replaces selected subtree ranges; reindent to destination indent.
- [x] Copy-paste remaps `^id` system lines to new IDs immediately.
- [x] Add Jest coverage for copy/cut/paste semantics.
- [x] Validate behavior in Obsidian (Live Preview) via 9222/CDP.
